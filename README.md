# BrickBreaker
This is a small brickbreaker game implemented in Java. I use Graphics and JFrame to display the game on the user's screen. The program can be executed by running the Main.java file.


# What I Learned:
- How to use JFrame Objects
- Custom classes
- Key and Action Listeners
- Overriding methods
